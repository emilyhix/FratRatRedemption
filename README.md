_You did it! You bore through the first week of school and made it to the most popular fraternity's first rager of the year! Are you going to fit in?! Or will everyone shun you forever?! Find out in **Frat Rat Redemption**, the "try to desperately fit in with everyone" RPG simulator game!_

Frat Rat Redemption is a terminal-based RPG that puts you in the shoes of a party goer at your first college party. Navigating through a top-down view of the frat house, you see a layout populated with interactable NPCs - your fellow party attendees. At this party, there are two stats which you must balance: Morality and Reputation. You start with mid-level morality and zero reputation. To gain reputation points, you must interact with NPCs, initiating a quick-time-event in which you can respond to the NPC's dialogue. Based on the interaction, the reputation and/or morality will be affected. You must gain and/or maintain the highest morality and reputation you can before you leave the frat house. Depending on your results as you leave the house, you will receive an ending corresponding to your success (or lack of success) in the frat house!
